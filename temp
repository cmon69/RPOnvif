I have enabled SSH, installed XRDP, and Samba after updating the Raspberry Pi.

```
sudo apt-get install xrdp
```
```
sudo apt-get install samba
```

You might get a message "If your computer gets IP address information from a DHCP server on the network, the DHCP server may
also provide information about WINS servers ("NetBIOS name servers") present on the network. This requires a change to
your snb.conf file so that DHCP-provided WINS settings will automatically be read from /var/lib/samba/dhcp.conf.
The dhcp-client package must be installed to take advantage of this feature.
Modify smb.conf to use WINS settings from DHCP?

I just select No

```
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
sudo smbpasswd -a pi
sudo reboot
```

Log into your Raspberry PI with Putty and type "sudo apt-get install samba"
You will get a prompt "Additional disk space will be used"
You will be asked if you want to continue y/n, type y and press “enter”. Once done type in
"sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf" to edit the config file. Delete the contents by pressing ctrl key and the K button.

Copy this Configuration and paste it in to the file. Make sure to in-enlarge your putty screen to make sure it’s all in there.

```

```

Exit by pressing ctrl and X keys then “Y” then the enter key. 

Next create a user "pi" 
To access the samba share.

Type in "sudo smbpasswd -a pi", and type in the password you want to used, and press enter. 
You will be asked to re-enter it, then press the enter key. Lastly restart the Samba Service by
typing "sudo reboot"
