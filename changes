Changes to be done

line ? of readme. "Run ‘sudo raspi-config’ and enable the camera and reboot.",
DONE but forgot , at "Run ‘sudo raspi-config’, enable the camera and reboot.",
you did "Run ‘sudo raspi-config’ enable the camera and reboot." but it is better.

README OVER

temp file fixes and suggestions

line ? "Log into your raspberry PI with Putty and type "sudo apt-get install samba""
raspberry PI should be spelled Raspberry Pi DONE but Pi is still spelled PI, not that big of an issue though.

line ? "Type in "sudo smbpasswd -a pi" type in the password you want to used and press enter."
DONE, forgot the , but its still better, you could have uesd , in place of "and"

line ? "You will be asked to re-enter it then press the enter key. Lastly restart the Samba Service by"
you should say "You will be asked to re-enter it, then press the enter key. Lastly restart the Samba Service by" instead. UNCLEAR
DONE, by the way "You will be asked to re-enter it then press the enter key."
kinda sounds like something its asking, yet it only asks to re-enter it, same thing with my example, thats confusing.
